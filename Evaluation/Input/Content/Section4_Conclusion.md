A whole-body PBPK model for atorvastatin acid has been successfully developed and verified integrating data of 15 clinical trials. Overall the model is able to adequately describe and predict atorvastatin acid plasma concentration-time profiles after single and multiple oral administrations across the range of 1 to 80 mg in healthy subjects.The final PBPK model comprises metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (if present) and also transport processes via BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, and P-gp. Moreover, the established PBPK model enriches the openly accessible PBPK model library by a new CYP3A4 and OATP1B1/1B3 substrate.
