The PBPK model for atorvastatin acid was developed and evaluated using publicly available clinical pharmacokinetic data from studies listed in [Section 2.2.2](#222-clinical-data).

The next sections show:

1. The final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-atorvastatin-final-input-parameters).
2. The overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-atorvastatin-diagnostics-plots).
3. Simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
